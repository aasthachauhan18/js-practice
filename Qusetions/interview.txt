1. What are the different data types in JavaScript?

JavaScript has 8 data-type:
Primitive types:

String – e.g., "Hello"

Number – e.g., 42, 3.14

BigInt – for large integers, e.g., 123n

Boolean – true or false

Undefined – variable declared but not assigned

Null – represents “no value”

Symbol – unique identifiers
Non-primitive:
Object – collection of key-value pairs (includes arrays, functions, etc.)


2. What is the difference between var, let, and const?
 var - > allow declaration and assignnment
 let - > allow assignnment
 const -> cant change

3. What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Hoisting means moving declarations to the top of their scope during compilation.
However, only the declaration is hoisted — not the initialization.

4. Explain the concept of closures.

A closure is created when a function “remembers” the variables from its outer scope even after that scope has finished executing.

5. What is the difference between == and ===?

== -> Compares value
=== -> compares datatype too


6. What is a callback function?
A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function and executed later.\

7. What are arrow functions?
Arrow functions are a shorter syntax for writing functions introduced in ES6.
They also don’t have their own this.

8. What is the difference between function declaration and function expression?

function declaration -> Hoisting allowed
function expression -> Hoisting not allowed

9. What are template literals?

Template literals (using backticks `) allow embedding variables and expressions easily using ${}.

10. What are default parameters in functions?

Default parameters let you assign a default value to a function parameter if no value is provided.
